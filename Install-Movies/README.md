## Tiberium Dawn
- If you have a slower/intermittent internet connection, download [cnc1_movies_full.rar](http://download.digiex.net/Games/C&C%20Gold/cnc1_movies_full.rar) first.
- Run `install-cnc.bat` on Windows or `bash install-cnc.sh` on Linux from within the Install-Movies folder.
    The script will download `cnc1_movies_full.rar` automatically if it is not found.

Note: the Content Manager for Tiberium Dawn (cnc) will say that the movies are not installed,
  however they will still play in the mission selector.

## Red Alert
- download [iran.cnc-comm.com/ra/PortableRA videos setup.exe](http://iran.cnc-comm.com/ra/PortableRA%20videos%20setup.exe)
- run it, set the extract location to `C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\OpenRA\Content\ra\v2`, replacing `YOUR_NAME` with your user account name.
- Linux users, thankfully it seems to run fine on WinE: `wine start /unix "PortableRA videos setup.exe"`,
    and set it to extract to `Z:\home\USERNAME\.openra\Content\ra\v2\movies` rather.

Note: these movies don't seem to be picked up by OpenRA, even if you move them to the v2 folder

## Dune 2000
- Download the torrent at https://gruntmods.com/download/911/, see [#1](https://github.com/Walkman100/OpenRA-Install-Guide/issues/1#issuecomment-222339414) for info
- Move the torrented file to this folder and run `install-d2k.bat` on Windows or `bash install-d2k.sh` on Linux from within the Install-Movies folder.
